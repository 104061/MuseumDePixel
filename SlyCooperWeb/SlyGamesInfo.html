                            The first game introduces Sly Cooper, a charming master thief descended from a long line of legendary raccoons. Alongside his best friends — Bentley, the genius turtle hacker, and Murray, the brawny but kind-hearted hippo driver — Sly sets out to recover his family’s ancient book, the Thievius Raccoonus, which contains generations of Cooper thieving techniques.
                            <br><br>
                            The book has been stolen and torn apart by a criminal group known as the Fiendish Five. Each member holds a section of the book. Sly travels across the world, defeating them one by one, reclaiming his family’s legacy, and ultimately confronting the leader, Clockwerk — a mechanical owl obsessed with destroying the Cooper Clan.

                            Months after defeating Clockwerk, Sly and his gang discover that his mechanical parts have been stolen by a criminal organization called the Klaww Gang. The parts are being used in black-market operations across the globe.
                            <br><br>
                            Sly, Bentley, and Murray must steal back the parts to prevent Clockwerk from being rebuilt — but the plot thickens when Interpol Inspector Carmelita Fox (Sly’s rival and love interest) and her new partner Constable Neyla get involved.
                            <br><br>
                            In the end, Neyla betrays everyone and fuses with Clockwerk’s remains to become Clock-La. The Cooper Gang defeats her, but Bentley is severely injured — leading to him being permanently wheelchair-bound. Murray, devastated, leaves the team for a while to find inner peace.

                            Sly learns of his family’s greatest treasure, locked away in the Cooper Vault on Kaine Island — but to open it, he’ll need a full team.
                            <br><br>
                            He reunites with Bentley and Murray and recruits new allies, including Penelope (a talented RC pilot), Dimitri (a reformed nightclub owner), The Guru, and Panda King (a former villain from the first game).
                            <br><br>
                            Meanwhile, a villain named Doctor M, who once worked for Sly’s father, wants the vault for himself. After a dramatic series of heists, Sly gains access, but to protect his friends, he fakes amnesia and begins a quiet life with Carmelita, who takes him in believing he’s “reformed.”

                            When pages of the Thievius Raccoonus begin disappearing, Bentley realizes something is wrong with history itself. The gang reunites, using a time-traveling device to visit Sly’s ancestors — like Rioichi Cooper (feudal Japan), Tennessee Kid Cooper (Wild West), and Sir Galleth Cooper (medieval England).
                            <br><br>
                            They discover the culprit is Le Paradox, a time-traveling skunk who’s kidnapping the Coopers’ ancestors to rewrite history and erase the Cooper name.
                            <br><br>
                            The gang stops him and restores the timeline, but in the end, Sly is accidentally stranded in ancient Egypt — the era of his earliest ancestor, Slytunkhamen Cooper I. His fate remains unknown, setting up a possible sequel.
